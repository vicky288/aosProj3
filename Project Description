Design and implement a replicated file system using the dynamic voting protocol discussed in the
class to ensure replica consistency. You can assume that the set of files in the file system is fixed
(new files cannot be created and existing files cannot be deleted), names of files do change and there
is only one directory, namely the root. Each file supports two operations: read and write/update.
Show that your file system works correctly by demonstrating that accesses to a file satisfy the
read-write mutual exclusion property. As in the previous project, your testing mechanism should
be as automated as possible and should require minimal human intervention. For example, visual
inspection of log files to verify the correctness of the execution will not be acceptable. You will be
graded on how accurate, complete and automated your testing mechanism is.
